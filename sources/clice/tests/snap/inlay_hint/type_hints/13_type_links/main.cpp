/// # Clickable type names

/// - status: supported

/// Each type name in a type hint links to its declaration: clicking it goes

///
/// A class declared ahead of its definition links to that declaration, from
/// which go-to-definition reaches the definition. Template arguments link one
/// by one; builtin types and punctuation stay plain text.
